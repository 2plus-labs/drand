# Drand

Drand is a distributed randomness beacon written in Go. Drand emits a publicly
verifiable unbiasable and unpredictable random value at a fixed interval. Having
a good random source is important in many protocols such as lottery, generating
random keys (SAY MORE).

**DISCLAIMER**: This software has NOT received a full audit and therefore should
NOT be put into production stage at this point. You have been warned.

## In a nutshell

Each participating node generates its own private key pair. A group file
describing all public keys of the participants is then created and distributed.
At that point, all nodes can run the distributed key generation part of drand to
generate a completely distributed keypair where each node have a share of the
distributed private key. After that, a special node called the leader starts a
beacon round at a fixed interval to produce a random value from a threshold of
online nodes. 

For more information about the cryptographic protocol, see PROTOCOL.md. For more
information about the design of drand, see DESIGN.md.

## Installation 

Two different ways of running drand are possible: either by installing via
Golang or using it in a Docker image. For the quickest setup, use the Docker
way.

### Installation via Docker

You need to have Docker installed on your system in order to continue.
Docker will download the image automatically the first time you launch the
image. For any drand command,  launch it as following:
```
docker run --rm --name drand -p <port>:<port> dedis/drand <command>
```

<port> is the port you want your container to expose in order to communicate
 with the other participants.

### Installation via Golang

You need to have Goland installed and setup you GOPATH. After that, a simple
```
go get github.com/dedis/drand
```
is enough to get you started.

## Usage

There are different stages that need to run in order to have a fully functional
drand beacon.

### Key generation

Each node generates their keypair using
```
drand keygen <address>
```
where address is in the form <ip>:<port>. The address is attached to the public
key so each node must be reachable at the address they specified.
By default, your keys are saved under `$HOME/.drand/drand_id.{secret,public}`.

### Group generation

To generate the group file listing all public keys, simply run:
```
drand group <pk1> <pk2> ... <pkn>
```
where <pkn> is the public key file of the n-th participant.
The group file is generated by default under `$HOME/.drand/drand_group.toml`.
That group file MUST be distributed to each of the node; it's best if the group
file is saved at the same place so there is no need for specifying the location
to drand.

### Beacon 

At the point, there needs to be a designated special node called the leader that
starts the protocol at a fixed interval. 
For the leader, run:
```
drand run --leader
```
or
```
drand run
```
for all other nodes.

The dealer can choose the period to wait between two runs with the `--period
DURATION` flag. DURATION can be for example `1mn` or `30s` (in fact, everything
understood by Golang's [duration
parsing](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration).
